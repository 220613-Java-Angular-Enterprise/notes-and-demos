# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open source Spring Framework project used to rapidly create Java based, production-grade applications utilizing Spring Framework's IOC and module integrations. Spring Boot simplifies the process of project startup and framework integration by applying highly opinionated auto-configurations for the different Spring Boot project modules like webmvc, data, security, messaging, etc... .

### Spring Boot Dependency Management

Needless to say Spring and Spring Boot require an increasing number of dependencies. Spring Boot projects are built using dependency packages. The basic Spring Boot dependency packages are included in the project configuration (pom.xml) file and are called `spring-boot-starter-*`. Including one `spring-boot-starter-*` is enough to get your project started as it will include all the necessary pieces required to start developing and testing your solutions. A basic Spring Boot application configuration will container 4 parts:

- parent configuration
- spring-boot-starter
- spring-boot-starter-test
- spring-boot-maven-plugin

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.1.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
  </parent>
  <groupId>com.ex</groupId>
  <artifactId>phase-1</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>phase-1</name>
  <description>Spring boot demo phase 1</description>

  <properties>
    <java.version>1.8</java.version>
  </properties>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
          <groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
          <artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```

That will be all that you need for a basic Spring Boot project. Lets illustrate the difference between a basic project and more complicated one. A simple Spring Boot Web application will also have 4 parts:

- parent configuration
- spring-boot-starter-webmvc
- spring-boot-starter-test
- spring-boot-maven-plugin

And that is all the, `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` dependency replaces the `spring-boot-starter` dependency, but it contains all of the dependencies needed for the basic application and the web application.

In the diagram you can see how the `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` is an extension of the `spring-boot-starter`.

## AutoConfiguration

As we have covered the core Spring Framework and how to integrate different modules and wire dependencies, the biggest draw to using Spring Boot is the autoconfiguration. Spring Boot takes a highly opinionated stance on the module integrations reducing the amount of Spring Configuration needed to start developing and testing your solutions. Imagine integrating webmvc without having to start a server, or register your dispatcher servlet, or register your internal view resolver. Spring Boot automatically assumes you need all of these beans, creates them and wires them together. Better yet it automatically prescribes the solutions and its alternatives.

To further elaborate on this example if you include the Spring Boot WebMVC module you will automatically get:

- Embedded Tomcat Servlet Container
- Standard DispatcherServlet
- JSP Internal View Resolver

To enable auto configuration in Spring Boot, you need to include `@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication` on a class. If you use `@EnableAutoConfiguration` then the class that the annotation is on must also be annotated with `@Configuration`. `@SpringBootApplication` doesn't require the same treatment, but it is important to note `@SpringBootApplication` is the combination of the `@SpringBootConfiguration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations.

The Spring team have created a tool call [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) to help create Spring Boot application. Any application created using `Spring Initializr` either through the site or IDE plugin/integrations, will be create with a main class that is already annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`

## Overriding Configuration/Custom Configuration
Beside the features surrounding automatic configuration, Spring Boot offers a couple of other ways to configure the application in a manual way. Manual/Custom configuration can be done through either Java `code` configuration or `application.properties`.

Supplying custom configuration in the `application.properties` is the easier but less dynamic way of application configuration. The `application.properties` file is a set of key/value pairs that supply values for module beans or your own application beans.

### Overriding some Module bean configuration (application.properties)
```properties
server.port=80
server.servlet.context-path=/myapp
spring.application.name=My Super Awesome Application
```

The above snippet will override the server port of the embedded server and the application context of the embedded server, also it will change the default application name.

Using Java `code` configuration is a bit more complicated, but it is more dynamic than `application.properties`. Using `code` configuration requires the developer to understand a lot about the associated beans in the module in order to override the default configuration.

### Configuring Hibernate beans in code
```java
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
@EnableJpaRepositories
public class HibernateBeanConfiguration {
  
}
```


## Running a Spring Boot Application

Running a Spring Boot application is just a matter of either configuring your IDE to run the `main` method of the main class or using the included maven wrapper with the command `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. It is important though to highlight the main method of the main class

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}
```

The `main` method invokes the `SpringApplication.run` method which is passed the class type of the main class. This starts the Spring Boot application using the main class as the root class for configuration and component scanning.

It is super important to remember to keep classes and interfaces inside of the same root package of the project. Otherwise it will be required to include an additional `@ComponentScan` annotation to enumerate the other packages for scanning.

# Stereotype Annotations

## Overview
Stereotypes are a number of built in annotations which are used as markers to declare obects as a bean, define their name and clarify to a developer what the bean will be used for.

### `@Component`
The `@Component` annotation is a generic stereotype used to declare an objects as a bean, which will be injected into other classes/beans at some point in time. Spring also provides more specific use cases for `@Component` beans when the class serves a specific purpose, such as the persistance of data, a service or presentation. These annotations are `@Repository`, `@Service` and `@Controller` respectively.

```
@Component("account");
public class Account {
    private int id;

    @Override
    public class toString() {
        return "Account [id=" + id +"]";
    }

    public Account() {
        super();
    }

    public Account (int id) {
        super();
        this.id = id;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```


### `@Repository`
The `@Repository` annotation marks a class to be used as a for use with storing data within a repository or database. Specifically, the `@Repository` annotation provides benefits for objects that would otherwise be utilized as a Data Access Object (DAO).

```
@Repository("accountRepository")
public class AccountRepositoryImpl implments AccountRepository {
    Connection connection = null;
    PreparedStatement stmt = null;

    @Override
    public List<Account> getAllAccounts() {

        List<Account> accounts = new ArrayList<Account>();
        try {
            connection = DAOUtilities.getConnection();
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM accounts";
            stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);

            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            while (rs.next()) {
                Account account = new account(rs.getInt("id"));
                accounts.add(account);
            }
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            closeResources();
        }
    
        return accounts;
    }
}
```

### `@Service`
The `@Service` annotation marks a class as a Service for an application

```
@Service("accountService");
public class AccountServiceImpl implements AccountService {

    @Autowired
    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    public List<Account> findAll() {
        return accountRepository.getAllAcounts();
    }
}


```

### `@Controller`
The `@Controller` annotation marks a class as a Spring MVC Controller which allow the use of handler mapping annotations. Classes annotated with `@Controller` are autodetected through classpath scanning, and when used in comination with `@RequestMapping`, allows for quick configurations of a web application controller.

```
@Controller("accountController")
public class accountControllerImpl {

    @Autowired
    private AccountService accountService;

    @RequestMapping(value="/accounts/all")
    public @ResponseBody List<Account> getAllAccounts() {
        Return accountService.findAll();
    }
}

```

In addition to readability, use of these stereotypes makes classes more suited for other processing tools, such as aspects or marking targets for pointcuts.


# Aspect Oriented Programming and Cross Cutting Concerns
Aspect Oriented Programming is another way to think about structuring your program, which can be used complementary to Object Oriented Programming. In object oriented programming, classes are used as the key component used to drive the creation of objects, which serve the purpose of representing concrete ideas or things with states and behaviors. In Aspect Oriented Programming, the key component are aspects, which modularizes particular transactional concerns which can present across multiple classes, known as _cross-cutting concerns_. Examples of these concerns are, Database Access (security for a database), data entities (transactions to take place), error handling, or logging system messages. The defining characteristic of these _cross-cutting concerns_ is that they are actions that can take place across your classes, regardless of the class function or structure. In traditional object oriented programming, this would result in code redundancy, as the same code must be called multiple times throughout an application to perform these actions. Aspect Oriented Programming works to eliminate this redundancy by transferring responsibility of these common problems to aspects. Note that the Spring IoC Container is not dependent on AOP; however, the Spring AOP framework complements the IoC Container by providing a capable middleware solution for concerns.

### Important Terminology
* _Aspect_ - A representation of a concern which cuts across multiple classes.
* _Weaving_ - The process of linking aspects with other objects, such as beans, to create advised objects. This can be done at compile time, load time or runtime. Spring performs weaving at Runtime.
* _Join Point_ - A specified moment during the execution of a program, such as the invocation of a method, in which actions can be taken.
* _Advice _ - Action taken by an aspect at a specified Join point. 
* _Pointcut_ - A definition of which methods in our application advice ought to be injected into or around, for example, when a method of a certain name is executed.

# Advice
Advice is specific actions taken, defined as a method, at a particular point during the execution of a program. There are five (5) types of advice, which controls at what point the action will take place.

* __Before__ - Advice that will execute before a join point, but does not have the capability to halt the normal execution of the proceeding join point (unless an exception is thrown)
* __After Returning__ - Advice that will execute after a join point completes without throwing an exception
* __After Throwing__ - Advice that will execute if a join point throws an exception.
* __After (finally)__ - Advice that will execute regardless of how the join point completes, whether normal or by throwing an exception.
* __Around__ - Advice that will execute before and after the join point. Around advice is the most general, but also most powerful kind of advice, as it can perform custom behavior before and after method invocation, and can be responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point method execution or shortcut the advised method by returning its own value or throwing an exception. In general it is recommended to use the least powerful type of advise for any particular task. For instance, if you only need to update a cache with a value returned from a method, it is best to use the _After Returning_ advice type.

All of these annotations, including the `@Aspect` annotation must be imported from the `org.aspectj.lang.annotation` pacakage.

### Before
_Before_ advice is declared using the `@Before` annotation:
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;

@Aspect
public class BeforeExample {

    @Before("com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()")
    public void doAccessCheck() {
        // ...
    }

}
```

### After Returning
_After Returning_ advice is declared using the `@AfterReturning` annotation:
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterReturning;

@Aspect
public class AfterReturningExample {

    @AfterReturning("com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()")
    public void doAccessCheck() {
        // ...
    }

}
```

Note that you can also bind `@AfterReturning` a returned value to the advice in order to access information from it (such as storing its value, or printing information specific to the returned data). This binding is declared using the `returning` attribute in the pointcut:
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterReturning;

@Aspect
public class AfterReturningExample {

    @AfterReturning(
        pointcut="com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()",
        returning="retVal")
    public void doAccessCheck(Object retVal) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
Here, "retVal" is the name given to the object being returned, and is referenced in the method signature of the `doAccessCheck` method by the same name.


### After Throwing
As you may assume, _After Throwing_ advice is declared with the `@After Throwing` annotation:
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterThrowing;

@Aspect
public class AfterThrowingExample {

    @AfterThrowing("com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()")
    public void doRecoveryActions() {
        // ...
    }

}
```

Similarly to `@AfterReturning`, you may reference a thrown exception within the advice through the use of the _throwing_ attribute, which allows you to reference the exception within the method signature of the advice by corresponding an argument in the method signature with the name declared with the _throwing_ attribute:
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterThrowing;

@Aspect
public class AfterThrowingExample {

    @AfterThrowing(
        pointcut="com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()",
        throwing="ex")
    public void doRecoveryActions(DataAccessException ex) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

### After (finally)
_After_ advice is declared using the `@After` annotation. Since it will execute after normal or exceptional completion of a method, you must make sure any `@After` advice is configured to handle both conditions:
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.After;

@Aspect
public class AfterFinallyExample {

    @After("com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()")
    public void doReleaseLock() {
        // ...
    }

}
```

### Around
```
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Aspect
public class AroundExample {
    private static Logger log = Logger.getLogget(LoggingAspect.class);

    @After("com.revature.example.dataAccessOperation()")
    public void performAroundAdvice() {
        log.info("This is Around Advice");
    }
}
```
