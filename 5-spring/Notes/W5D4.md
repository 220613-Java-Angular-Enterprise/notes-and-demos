# Rest

REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. 

The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. 

Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. 

REST uses a resource identifier to identify the particular resource involved in an interaction between components.

## Client- Server

The client-server design pattern enforces the separation of concerns, which helps the client and the server components evolve independently.

By separating the user interface concerns (client) from the data storage concerns (server), we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.

While the client and the server evolve, we have to make sure that the interface/contract between the client and the server does not break.

## Stateless

Statelessness mandates that each request from the client to the server must contain all of the information necessary to understand and complete the request.

The server cannot take advantage of any previously stored context information on the server.

For this reason, the client application must entirely keep the session state.

## Cacheable

The cacheable constraint requires that a response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non-cacheable.

If the response is cacheable, the client application gets the right to reuse the response data later for equivalent requests and a specified period.

## Uniform Interface

By applying the principle of generality to the components interface, we can simplify the overall system architecture and improve the visibility of interactions.

Multiple architectural constraints help in obtaining a uniform interface and guiding the behavior of components.

The following four constraints can achieve a uniform REST interface:

- Identification of resources
- Manipulation of resources through representations
- Self-descriptive messages
- Hypermedia as the engine of application state

### RESTful services should have uniform resource indentifiers, so here are some rules you can follow to conform to this

-   use nouns to name resources
-   begin your uri the plural collection of a particular resource
-   use path parameters to identify a single resource in a specific document/record
-   capitalize on path structure to represent heirarchy
-   Identify stores of resources that are managed by the client (sub-collections)
-   use query parameters to filter resources of a particular type
-   be consistant accross the board

### Hypermedia

Hypertext (or hypermedia) means the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions.

## Layered System

The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior.

For example, in a layered system, each component cannot see beyond the immediate layer they are interacting with.

## Code On Demand(Optional)

REST also allows client functionality to extend by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.

The downloaded code simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. Servers can provide part of features delivered to the client in the form of code, and the client only needs to execute the code.

# Rest API

## What is an API?

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

An API is a messenger that abides by a contract.  The contract states:

“Give me this information formatted in a particular way, and I will give you a response.”

An API is like a “waiter” between client (guest) and server (kitchen)

## What is a REST API?

- Architectural style for designing networked applications

- Relies on stateless, client/server protocol -- almost always HTTP

- Treats Server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed

    - Think CRUD!

    - HTTP Verbs

A RESTful API is an interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other over the internet and through various devices. Every time you access an app like Facebook or check the weather on your smartphone, an API is used.

### Review - HTTP Methods

- GET
    - Retrieve data from a specified resource
    - https://site.com/api/users OR https://site.com/api/users/1

- POST
    -  Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
    -  https://site.com/api/users (add)

- PUT
    - Update a specified resource
    - https://site.com/api/users/1

- DELETE
    - Delete a specified resource
    - https://site.com/api/users/1

#### Endpoints
The URL/URI where the api/service can be accessed by a client application

## Richardson Maturity Model
Leonard Richardson analyzed a hundred different web service designs and divided these designs into four categories. These categories are based on how much the web services are REST compliant.

# Spring MVC

Spring MVC is a request driven structure centered around a central Servlet using the front controller design pattern

Servlets are the underlying technology that allows Java to interface between clients through the internet

## Front Controller Design Pattern

<img src = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/images/spring_dispatcherservlet.png">

The front controller design pattern provides a single handler for all incoming requests for a resource in an application, then dispatches the requests to the appropriate secondary handler for that type of request.

It uses a helper api to achieve the dispatching mechanism, it is broken up into four differen components

Front controller is the single point of entry for requests, it directs requests to the dispatcher

Dispatcher is reposponsible for managing the actions and the views, including locating and routing to specific actions that will service a request, and finding the correct view

Helper classes are used to break up the logic of specific features, and makes the program easier to build and maintaine

Views represent and display information that we want to display to the client

The Spring DispatchServlet is completely integrated with the Spring IOC container

The Dispatch Servlet routes requests to handlers, view resolvers, and also provides support for uploading files

Since DispatchServlet is a servlet itself it must mapped it in the web.xml

View Resolvers will retrieve the correct view from controller

# InternalViewResourceResolver

The InternalResourceView is a Wrapper class for JSP or other resources within the same web application. It can be used to expose model objects as request attributes and forward requests to a specified resource URL using the RequestDispatcher. In particular the InteralResourceViewResolver supports definitions for InternalResourceViews for a simple and straightforward resolution of @Controller class methods.

# Spring MVC Annotations

## @Controller:

Will mark the class as a controller, which is a special kind of spring bean that handles requests, the dispatcher will scan for these classes, and send requests to the correct controller

## @RequestMapping:

Used to map a uri to a specific class, or to a specific method inside of a controller, you can also include the http method if it is over a method

## @RequestBody:

Use this annotation to gain access to the object sent with the request

## @ResponseBody:

This annotation will automatically convert the return of the method to the correct json object to send in the response back to the client

## @RestController:

A class level annotation that combines @RequestMapping and @ResponseBody, allows you to return from the controller methods normally, without a ResponseBody annotation

## Path Paremeters and Query Parameters

Path Parameters and Query Parameters are ways to send information to the server without using a POST request, these should only be used to send information that is none confidential. To set these up you use the @RequestParam and @PathVariable in the method parameters

Path Variable allows you to add a value after the last slash of the request uri, ex `http://url/get/variable`

Query Parameters use a ? in the uri then you define the parameters you are sending over, ex `http:url/get?var=name`

# Spring Boot DevTools

Spring Boot DevTools implements two useful features

-   Cache Disabling: cache is helpful in production, but can hinder development workflow, DevTools automatically diables caching
-   Automatic Restarts: anytime you make a change to your application, developement will server will restart automatically

# Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator is a Spring Library that exposes tools for monitoring and gatering metric about a running application

You can utilize Actuators predefined endpoints to view different information about your application:

-   /health: shows the applications health
-   /beans: shows a list of available beans in the BeanFactory
-   /env: return the current application properties
-   /info: return general data, this can be customized
-   /logfile: return the content of the logfile
-   /loggers: show or modify logger configurations
-   /mapping: show all @RequestMappings
-   /metrics: show metric information about the application
-   /shutdown: shutdown the application

In the application.properties you can turn on or off specific endpoints
