# Collections Framework
The Collections framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly used data structures. A collection is a single object which acts as a container for other objects. The Collections API is organized in a class hierarchy shown in simplified version below:

<img src = "https://javaconceptoftheday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CollectionHierarchy.png" width = "600">

The important interfaces in the Collections API are:
* `Iterable` - guarantees the collection can be iterated over
* `List` - an ordered collection
* `Set` - a collection does not contain duplicates
* `Queue` - a collection that operates on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis
* `Map` - contains key/value pairs. Does not extend `Iterable`.

## Iterable and Iterator
The `Iterable` interface defines a data structure which can be directly traversed using the `.iterator()` method, which returns an `Iterator`. This can be useful for fine-grained control over iteration. The `Iterator` interface contains methods for traversal, including:
* `hasNext()`
* `next()`
* `remove()`

For example:

```java
Set<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
// add names...
Iterator<String> it = names.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
  String name = it.next();
  doSomething(name);
}
```

## Enhanced For Loop - Review
Any object which implements the `Iterable` interface can also be iterated over using a special kind of `for`-loop: the "enhanced" for loop. The syntax is as follows:

```java
Set<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
// add names...
for (String name : names) {
  System.out.println(name);
}
```
The downside of the enhanced for loop is that the index of iteration is not tracked, so fine-grain control over execution is not possible. However, this simplified syntax is beneficial for many simple iterations.

## Generics
Generics are constructs introduced in Java 5 which enforce compile time safety by allowing you to use parameterized types. They are covered here because the are frequently and heavily used with collections. Generics can be declared on a class (generic types), method parameters (generic methods), or return types.

Before Java 5, you had to write something like this and hope other developers understood to only put Strings inside: 
```
List names = new ArrayList();
names.add("Alice"); // good use
name.add(new Object()); // uh oh - we want to prevent this from happening
```

With generics, you can restrict a class to only accept objects of a given type and the compiler will prevent you from using any other type:
```
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>(); // using a List of Strings only
names.add("Alice"); // nice!
names.add(new Object()); // now we get a compilation error to stop this - generics save the day!
```

## Generic Classes
To make a class (or interface) generic, use the angle brackets when declaring it, and use an arbitrary "generic type" which is determined by the invoking code. The generic type can then be reused throughout the class to enforce type safety.

```java
public class MyGenericClass<T> {
  private T instance;
  
  // simple generic setter method
  public void setObject(T object) {
    this.instance = object;
  }
}
```

## Naming Convention for Generics
Technically, type parameters can be named anything you want. The convention is to use single, uppercase letters to make it obvious that they are not real class names.
* E => Element
* K => Map Key
* V => Map Value
* N => Number
* T => Generic data type
* S, U, V, and so on => For multiple generic data types

# List Interface
A `List` is a collection that is ordered and preserves the order in which elements are inserted into the list. Contrary to sets, duplicate entries are allowed. Also, elements are accessed by their index, which begins with 0 for the first element in the list.

## ArrayList
An `ArrayList` is a concrete class which implements `List`. It is a data structure which contains an array within it, but can resize dynamically. Once it reaches maximum capacity, an `ArrayList` will increase its size by 50% by copying its elements to a new (internal) array. Traversal is fast (constant time) because elements can be randomly accessed via index, just like an array. Insertion or removal of elements is slow, however (linear time, since there is a risk of having to resize the underlying array).

## LinkedList
A `LinkedList` implements both the `List` and `Queue` interfaces, so it has all methods in both interfaces. The data structure is composed of nodes internally, each with a reference to the previous node and the next node - i.e. a doubly-linked list. Because of this structure, insertion or removal of elements is fast (no risk to resize, just change the nearest references), but traversal is slow for an arbitrary index (linear time).

### Vector
`Vector` is an older class which implements `List` - it is essentially a thread-safe implementation of an `ArrayList`.


# Set Interface
`Set` is an interface which defines a data structure which:
* is NOT index driven
* only allows unique elements
* generally DOES NOT preserve the order in which elements were inserted

### HashSet
A `HashSet` implements `Set` and is backed by a `HashMap`. It:
* Guarantees no ordering when iterating
* Allows one `null` value
* Allows fast insertion and traversal
* Does not maintain order in which you insert elements

### TreeSet
A `TreeSet` is a `Set` whose elements maintain sorted order when inserted. Internally, it is backed by a Sorted Tree. Insertion and removal of elements is slow, because the elements must maintain sorted order. It cannot contain any `null` values, since `null` cannot be compared to any object.


# Collections Class
The [Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html) class - not to be confused with the Collection interface - defines many `static` helper methods which operate on any given collection. Use this class for help with sorting, searching, reversing, or performing other operations on collections.


# Introduction to Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a dependency manager and build automation tool for Java programs. Maven project configuration and dependencies are handled via the Project Object Model, defined in the `pom.xml` file. This file contains information about the project used to build the project, including project dependencies and plugins.

Maven identifies projects through **project coordinates** defined in the `pom.xml` file - these are:
* `group-id` - for example: "com.revature"
* `artifact-id` - for example: "myproject"
* `version` - for example: "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"

Together, these uniquely identify a specific version of a program.

Some other important tags within the `pom.xml` file include:
* `<project>` - this is the root tag of the file
* `<modelVersion>` - defining which version of the page object model to be used
* `<name>` - name of the project
* `<properties>` - project-specific settings
* `<dependencies>` - this is where you put your Java dependencies you want to use. Each one needs a `<dependency>`, which has:
  * `<groupId>`
  * `<artifactId>`
  * `<version>`
* `<plugins>` - for 3rd party plugins that work with Maven

## Maven Repositories

When Maven "builds" a Java project, it must first search for any dependencies declared in the `pom.xml` file. Maven dependencies are stored both locally and in a central repository. The local repository is in the `$HOME/.m2/repository` folder (can be changed in `$MAVEN_HOME/conf/settings.xml`), while the central repository is accessible at https://mvnrepository.com. If Maven cannot find a given dependency locally, it searches the central repository for the artifact and then downloads it to the local repository.

A Maven "build" means to take the project source code, along with any dependencies like libraries or frameworks, compile it, and bundle it all together into an artifact - this could be a `.war` file, a `.jar` file, or an `.ear` file. WAR stands for "web archive", JAR stands for "Java archive", and EAR stands for "Enterprise Application archive". This artifact can then be either directly run or deployed onto a web container (in the case of a web application).

## Maven Build Lifecycle
When Maven builds your project, it goes through several steps called **phases**. The default maven build lifecycle goes through the following phases:
1. Validate => project is correct and all necessary information is available 
2. Compile => compiles project source code 
3. Test => tests all compiled code 
4. Package => packages all compiled code to WAR/JAR file 
5. Integration => performs all integration tests on WAR/JAR
6. Verify => runs checks on the results of integration tests 
7. Install => installs WAR/JAR to local repository 
8. Deploy => copies final WAR/JAR to the remote repository

## Introduction to Testing

Testing is a very broad term and encompasses many different strategies, levels, and techniques. You've probably done **manual testing** before simply by running your application code, providing some user input, and observing the resulting behavior of the system and noting any deviations from expectations. This kind of testing is effective in certain scenarios, but it doesn't scale well when you need to test the functionality of an application with 100s, 1000s, or 10s of thousands of lines of code, and be able to do so repeatedly in timely fashion.

To effectively test a non-trivial application, we can actually write test code which will test the functionality of our application code. When we are testing the smallest individual components of the application in isolation from other parts of the system, this is called **unit testing**.

## Unit Testing
Unit testing is the testing of individual software components in isolation from the rest of the system. This is done by writing unit tests which execute the code we want to inspect. When the code under test deviates from an expected outcome or behavior, the test will fail. If a test passes, it means the application performs as expected (unless there is a problem with the test itself). In Java, the most common unit testing framework is called JUnit.

## JUnit
JUnit is a Java framework for unit testing. JUnit has several annotations within the `org.junit` package that developers can use to create tests and setup test environments:
* `@Test` - declares a method as a test method
* `@BeforeClass` - declares a setup method that runs once, before all other methods in the class
* `@Before` - declares a setup method that runs before each test method
* `@After` - declares a tear-down method that runs before each test method
* `@AfterClass` - declares a tear-down method that runs once, after all other methods in the class

When writing a test method, JUnit helps us check the functionality of the code being tested by providing static `Assert` methods, of which there are many. A few include:
* `assertTrue()`
* `assertFalse()`
* `assertEquals()`
* `assertNotEquals()`
* `assertThat()`

Assertions verify that the state of the application meets what is expected. For example, to test a simple addition method:

```java
@Test
public void additionTest() {
  Assert.assertEquals(4, Calculator.addNumbers(2,2));
}
```

If the `.addNumbers()` method returns anything other than `4`, the test will fail. This will alert us that something is wrong in the logic of the method and we can then debug the issue. When we think we've fixed the problem, just run the test again and check that it passes.

**Note:** to avoid needing to reference `Assert` every time, we can use a `static import org.junit.Assert.*;` statement to import all `static` members of the `Assert` class.

### Ignoring Tests

To prevent a test from running, use the `@Ignore` annotation. Use this sparingly, however, because ignoring valid tests only means that you are pretending a problem does not exist. If tests are constantly ignored, you will have no guarantee that the application functionality has not regressed.

### Testing Best Practices
When it comes to testing code, a few best practices to follow include:
* [Utilize dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
* [Write testable code](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters)
* Use a mocking library like [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) for dependencies
* Measure your code coverage with a tool like [Jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html)
* Externalize test data when possible (i.e. read in the test data from an external file or generate it dynamically)
* Generally, you want to use **only 1 assert statement per test** - this ensures you can pinpoint the defect when debugging
* Write deterministic tests (they shouldn't fail sometimes and pass other times - otherwise known as "flaky" tests)

## TDD
When developing software, it is important to ensure that most if not all of the code being written is tested to verify the functionality of the code. One way to ensure this is to follow a process called **test-driven development**, or TDD.

### TDD Process
The TDD process consists of writing unit tests first, **before** the application code has been written. Then, code can be written to make the test pass and the process can be completed for each piece of functionality required. Thus, the process is:
1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test => test will fail
3. Fix the test by writing application code
4. Retest until the test passes
5. Repeat

Following the TDD process can be useful for ensuring that a valid unit tests always exists for any class or method that is written. Later, when refactoring code, the unit tests give us confidence that we can change the source code without breaking existing functionality. If we mess up somewhere, when the unit tests are run we can pinpoint exactly where the problem lies. This makes debugging much easier.
