# HTTP Background
***Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)*** is a client-server protocol. This means the client or consumer must initiate the communication. 
 
Information is transferred via multiple messages- it's akin to the way we send letters. 
 
The HTTP protocol is part of the application layer and thus requires some underlying communication protocol to transmit data- that protocol is TCP. 
 
# HTTP Requests
HTTP Requests are composed of: 
- Verb
    - Indicates the executing HTTP method.
- URI
    - Specifies the endpoint where the resource is located.
- HTTP Version.
- Request Header
    - META-DATA (information) of the Request as key-value pairs such as format supported by the client, browser type, etc.
- Request Body
    - Message content or resource representation.
    
 
# HTTP Responses
- HTTP Response
    - Response Code
    - 200 (OK), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Error), etc.
- HTTP Version.
- Response Header
    - META-DATA for the Response such as: content length, content type, date, etc.
- Response Body
    - Some kind of payload in the case where HTTP is used in the context of a RESTful service then the body is a resource representation. 


 
# Verbs 
HTTP request verbs or methods indicate the action that a client hopes to perform. 
 
Characteristics of requests:
(Basically, a request either is or isn't each of these) 
- idempotent
    - A request method is considered idempotent if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same as the effect for a single such request.
- safe
    - doesn't alter the server's state
    - read-only
- cacheable
    - Determines if there is a chance the response to the corresponding method can be cached 
- allowed in HTML forms
- request has a body

# Status Codes
- Informational responses (100–199)

- Successful responses (200–299)

- Redirects (300–399)

- Client errors (400–499)

- Server errors (500–599)

- Further Breakdown of Status Codes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

# Headers

HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. Think META-DATA about the msg.

- [Request Headers Example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header)


- [Response Headers Example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header)

# Stateless

Even though multiple requests can be sent over the same HTTP connection, the server does not attach any special meaning to their arriving over the same socket. That is solely a performance thing, intended to minimize the time/bandwidth that'd otherwise be spent reestablishing a connection for each request.

As far as HTTP is concerned, they are all still separate requests and must contain enough information on their own to fulfill the request. That is the essence of "statelessness". 

Requests will not be associated with each other UNLESS  there is some shared info the server knows about, which in most cases is a session ID in a cookie.

# Data Interchange Format: XML vs. JSON

- JSON and XML fulfil a similar purpose of organizing complex data in an understandable and readable format to various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and programming languages

- This type of technology is essential because structuring the data is what allows us to share it successfully.

## XML (Extensible Markup Language)
 
- XML is extensible. It lets you define your own tags, the order in which they occur, and how they should be processed or displayed. Another way to think about extensibility is to consider that XML allows all of us to extend our notion of what a document is: it can be a file that lives on a file server, or it can be a transient piece of data that flows between two computer systems (as in the case of Web Services).

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- JSON is language-independent (just like XML), meaning you can use it with any programming language.

- File size is smaller

- JSON is compact and very easy to read, the files look cleaner and more organized without empty tags and data. Contrarily, XML is often characterized for its complexity and old-fashioned standard due to the tag structure that makes files bigger and harder to read.

# Client Server Architecture

A client-server architecture is a networking model in which the server provides services to clients to perform user-based tasks. A client and a server are two pieces of software that might be on the same computer, or two different computers that might be separated by miles but connected by the Internet.

**Server** - A server is software designed to process requests and deliver responses to another computer over the internet.

**Client** - A client is a program that runs on a local machine requesting service from the server.


## Types of Client-Server Architecture

**2 tier architecture** - The user interface stored at the client machine and the database stored on the server. If Business Logic & Data Logic collected at a client-side, then it is known as a *fat client thin server architecture*. If Business Logic & Data Logic handled on the server, then it is known as a *thin client fat server architecture*. 2 tier architecture has some limitations in performance, security, and portability.

<img src = "https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*xKI22k-tiKbHfNJG-GFDBg.png">

**3 tier architecture** - Three-tier architecture has a middleware between the user interface and database. The 3 tiers are named the presentation tier, application tier, and data tier. The presentation tier is the front end layer and consists of the user interface. The application tier contains the functional business logic which drives an application’s core capabilities. The data tier consists of a database system and the data access layer.

**n-tier architecture** - In n-tier architecture, there are multiple Business Logic & Data Logic layers. It increases the flexibility and reusability of applications but can be difficult to implement.

# Static Web Application

A Static Web Application is non-interactive and provides generic information for the client that’s accessing it.

- Static Web Apps do not require server-side programming

- Static Web Apps do not require databases

# Dynamic Web Applications

A Dynamic Web Application is comprised of Servlets and server-side components

- When a client accesses a web application, the dynamic app contacts the database to save, update, delete, or read, then send a dynamic response which it creates

- A dynamic web application runs on a web container, which knows how to work with a servlet and other components to generate a dynamic response and send it to the web client.

- Involves server-side programming and a database!

# Server Side Programming

A web container (like Tomcat) is a PART of the Web Server that manages server-side components such as servlets...it’s PART of the Web Server!

- Web Containers provide the runtime environment and lifecycle management for the components (i.e servlets)

- A web server (or HTTP Server) is capable of handling HTTP Requests sent by a client and responds back with an HTTP response.

Duties of a Server Side Program

- Handle the client request by capturing the user-input

- Connects and communicates with Database

- Processes Data

- Produce the response page (a dynamic HTML response page, creating HTML on the fly!)

- Then, it hands this response page back to the web server, which sends it as a response to the client (browser)

# Servlets

A website can consist of both static and dynamic webpages. A static webpage is a pre-built HTML page with the content explicitly written into the code, and stored in the webserver. Static web pages display the same content each time we visit. A dynamic webpage loads dynamic content *such as stock prices, weather information, news, and sports updates* at different points of time.  In Java, there exists a way to generate static webpages with dynamic data, and that's with **Java Servlets**.

A **Servlet** is a Java class that takes incoming requests, processes them, and generates a response to send back to the user. For example, an `HttpServlet` takes an HTTP request, processes its headers and content, and uses that information to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into an HTTP response that can be sent back to the user's browser. The **Servlet container** is the component of an **application server** that interacts with Java servlets and is responsible for managing the execution of servlets and JSP pages for Java applications.

```
User  -->  HTTP Request  -->   Application Server  -->  Servlet Container  
                                                               |
                                                               V   
User  <--  
```

## How do servlets work?

When a client sends a request to the application server, the application server receives and passes the request to the appropriate servlet. The servlet processes the request, generates the response, and sends the response back to the application server.  The application server sends the response back to the client. Most servlets are HTTPServlets, which receive HTTP requests and generate HTTP Responses out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. 

## Life Cycle of a Servlet


A **servlet container** manages the life cycle of a servlet. [Servlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html) is an interface defined in **`javax.servlet`** package. A servlet container uses the Servlet interface to understand a specific Servlet object and manage it.

There are three life cycle methods of a Servlet :
* `init()`
* `service()`
* `destroy()`


The steps involved in the servlet life cycle are listed below:

**Step-1 : Loading of Servlet**  

When the application server (e.g. Apache Tomcat) starts up, the servlet container deploys and loads all the servlet classes.

**Step-2 : Creating an instance of Servlet** 

Once all the Servlet classes are loaded, the servlet container creates only one instance for each servlet class. All requests to the servlet are executed on that same servlet instance. Some application servers can create multiple instances of a servlet to handle a high volume of incoming requests, but that is not the default behavior.

**Step-3 : Invoke `init()` method once**

Once all the servlet classes are instantiated, the init() method is invoked for each instantiated servlet. The `init()` method is used to initialize the servlet. The `init()` method is called only once. 


**The `init()` method signature:** 
```java
public void init() throws ServletException {
}
```

**Step-4 : Invoke `service()` method repeatedly for each client request** 

The servlet container calls the service method each time a request for the servlet is received. The service() method determines the type of Http request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) also calls `doGet()`, `doPost()`, `doPut()`, `doDelete()`, etc. methods as appropriate. 

**The `service()` method signature:** 
```java
public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { 
}
```

**Step-5 : Invoke destroy() method once**

The `destroy()` method is called only once at the end of the a servlet's life. The servlet container calls this method before removing the servlet instance from the service.

**The `destroy()` method signature:** 
```java
public void destroy() {
}
```

## Servlet API

The [Servlet API](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/package-tree.html) provides interfaces and classes that are required to build servlets. These interfaces and classes represented in  two packages:

1. **`java.servlet`** package -  used by the servlet or web container.
2. **`javax.servlet.http`** package - used for handling http requests.

## Servlet Class Hierarchy:

The Servlet interface is the root interface of the servlet class hierarchy. The GenericServlet class implements Servlet, ServletConfig, and Serializable interfaces. The HttpServlet class extends the GenericServlet class and implements the Serializable interface. It provides HTTP methods such as doGet, doPost, doHead, doTrace, etc.

<img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/43/b2/5543b2d68ce3753eced7651dfd388d44.jpg" width =1000>


The user defined servlet class is created by implementing the *Servlet* interface, usually by extending the *GenericServlet* class or (more commonly) the *HttpServlet* class.
