# Session Management in servlets

The HTTP protocol is a **stateless protocol**, which means no client information stored in the server. The server considers every request form the same client as a new, independent request. 
However, this means that a server cannot keep a user "logged in" naturally. 

Instead, the client will have to re-identify itself with each request it sends. One workaround is to have the server create a **session** for each client request, which the client can re-associate itself with in each request by sending the **session ID**.





**For example**, When a user logs in to a website, a token proving a successful login will be associated with their session, and the session ID will be returned to the client. Whatever web page user visits after logging in, their browser will send that session ID with each request, and the server can check that session to validate that the user was successfully authenticated.

Session tracking is a mechanism that **servlets use to maintain state** about a series of requests from the same user across a period of time.

A session stores the **unique identification information about the client** that we can get for all requests that client makes. There are four different techniques used by the Servlet application for session management. 
* Cookies
* Hidden form fields
* URL Rewriting
* The HttpSession API


# Hidden Form Fields

Hidden fields can be inserted into webpages by the server for session tracking. <br/>
These fields are not visible directly to the user but can still be viewed using the *view source* option from the browser.
Therefore, hidden fields should *not* be used as a form of security.

Hidden fields may be used to send information that is only pertinent to the server, and not the client.

A web server can send a hidden HTML form field along with a unique session ID:
```html
<input type = "hidden" name = "session_id" value = "65349">
```

This hidden field is not displayed on the browser but the value is sent to the server when the parent `<form>` element is submitted. 

The server retrieves this hidden form field value using the `request.getParameter("session_id")` method in a servlet.

# URL Rewriting

URL Rewriting is a process by which a **unique session ID gets appended to each request URL**, so the server can identify the user session.

URL Rewriting maintains the session and works even the user's browser doesn't support cookies.  This makes it one of the ways in which we can provide a unique id in request and response, alongside implementing the Session Interface and Cookies Management.

## Example

We will create an **HTML page** to capture a username value from the client, a **FirstServlet** which will print the username, and then provide the url pass control to **SecondServlet** using url rewriting. 


### Create <code>index.html</code> Form

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>HTML Form</title>
</head>
<body>
	<form action="FirstServlet" method="get">
			Name:<input type="text" name="userName" /><br><br/> 
			     <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
	</form>
</body>
</html>
```


### Create <code>FirstServlet.java</code>

```java
@WebServlet("/FirstServlet")
public class FirstServlet extends HttpServlet { 

    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
    { 
        try { 
            response.setContentType("text/html"); 

            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); 

            // request.getParameter takes the value from index.html file where name is "userName" 
            String n = request.getParameter("userName"); 
            out.print("Welcome " + n); 
  
  
            /** url rewriting is used for creating a session - it will redirect  you to SecondServlet page 
                Notice that we have set the query parameter ?uname equal to the userName parameter we retrieved from the request
            **/
            out.print("<a href='SecondServlet?uname=" + n + "'>visit</a>"); 
  
            out.close(); 
        } 
        catch (Exception e) { 
            System.out.println(e); 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

We appply URL rewriting in the FirstServlet when we pass control to the SecondServlet.
```java
out.print("<a href='SecondServlet?uname=" + n + "'>pass control to secondServlet</a>"); 
```


### Create <code>SecondServlet.java</code>

```java
@WebServlet("/SecondServlet")
public class SecondServlet extends HttpServlet { 
  
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
    { 
        try { 
  
            response.setContentType("text/html"); 
           
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); 

            // use request.getParameter() to get the value from the url that we have rewritten in  FirstServlet
            String n = request.getParameter("uname"); 
            out.print("Hello " + n); 
            
            out.close(); 
        } 
        catch (Exception e) { 
            System.out.println(e); 
        } 
    } 
}
```

The benfit of URL rewriting is that it doesnâ€™t depend upon cookies and will work whether cookies are enabled or disabled.  Extra form submission is not required on all pages.

# Cookies

A cookie is a key-value pair of information sent by the server to the client, which the client will store.  The client (usually a web browser) can send this cookie in the HTTP request header for all subsequent requests until the cookie becomes invalid.

The Servlet container checks the request header for cookies, most commonly to get the session information from the cookie, which it uses it to retrieve the associated session data stored in the server.

We can classify the cookies into two types based on their expiry time:

* **Non-persistent cookie** - Cookie becomes expired when the user closes the browser.

* **Persistent Cookies** - Cookie expires only if the user logs out of the website.  The cookie is stored on the browser even the user closes the browser each time. 

### Creating Cookies with Servlets

To send cookies to the client, we need to create a Cookie object, set the maximum age for the cookie, and place the cookie in the HTTP response header.
The `Cookie(String name, String value)` constructor defined in the **javax.servlet.http.Cookie** class can be used to create a cookie with a specified name and value. We can use the `setMaxAge()` method to set the maximum age for the particular cookie in seconds. We can use the `response.addCookie()` method to place the cookie in the HTTP response header.

**Example:**
```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
    
    //Creating a Cookie object
    Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name","Adam");
    
    // Set expiry date after 24 Hrs (86,400seconds)
    cookie.setMaxAge(86400);
    
    // Add the cookie in the response header
    response.addCookie(cookie);
}
```

### Reading Cookies with Servlets

To read cookies, We need to create an array of javax.servlet.http.Cookie objects by calling the `getCookies()` method of HttpServletRequest. Then the `getName()` and `getValue()` methods used to access each cookie and associated value.


**Example:**
```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {

    //getting all the cookies
    Cookie cookies[]=request.getCookies();
 
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
    for(Cookie c : cookies){  
        out.println("Name: "+c.getName()+" & Value: "+c.getValue());
    }
}
```
# HttpSession API

The Servlet API provides **HttpSession Interface**, which provides a way to identify a user and to store information about that user. For the client's first request, the Servlet Container generates a **unique session ID** and gives it back to the client with a response. Thereafter, the client sends the session ID with each request to the server.

The **getSession()** method of the *HttpServletRequest* object returns a user's session. Any servlet can access the *HttpSession* object using getSession() method. 

Example for creating the *HttpSession* object: 
```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
        HttpSession session = request.getSession();
}
```
The commonly used HttpSession Interface methods are listed below:

* **setAttribute(key,object)** - used to bind an object to the session, using the key specified. 
* **getAttribute(String)**  - used to retrieve a specific saved object from the session object, using its key.
* **removeAttribute(key)**  - used to remove the object bound with the specified key from the session.
* **invalidate()** - destorys the session.
* **getId()**  - returns the unique ID assigned to the session.
* **getCreationTime()**- returns the time when the session was created
* **getLastAccessedTime()** - returns the last time the client sent a request associated with the session
* **getMaxInactiveInterval()** - returns the maximum time interval, in seconds.
* **setMaxInactiveInterval(int interval)** - Specifies the time, in seconds,after servlet container will invalidate the session.
