## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Various Features of Cloud Computing

- Resource Pooling
- On-Demand Self-Service
- Easy Maintenance
- Lage Network Access
- Availability
- Automatic System
- Economical
- Security
- Pay As You Go
- Measured Service

## 3 Models of Cloud Computing

- Software As A Service (SaaS)
- Platform As A Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)

## Regions and Availability Zones

### Regions

A highly available data center that houses Amazon cloud computing resources in different areas of the world (25 in total)

### Availability Zones

Each AWS Region contains multiple distinct locations called Availability Zones, or AZs. Each Availability Zone is engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. (80 total in the world)

## Amazon RDS

- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. 

- Amazon RDS is a Paas

## What is AWS EC2?

AWS EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) is a web service offered by Amazon that provides resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. It enables you to manage a Linux/UNIX and Windows server instances in Amazon’s Data Centers

- It offers Infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

- It provides complete control of computing resources, which one can scale as per the requirement.

### AMI

- You use preconfigured templates for your instances known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

An AMI includes the following:

- A template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
- Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it’s launched.

### What is an EC2 Instance?

A virtual server used for running applications on Amazon’s EC2 is an instance. An instance can be understood as a small part of a large computer, having its own hard drive, network connection, OS, etc. You can have multiple small computers on a single physical machine, and all these small machines are called Instances.

### EBS - Elastic Block Store

- Elastic Block Store is a system storage for Amazon EC2 VM’s

- An "EBS-backed" instance is an EC2 instance which uses an EBS volume as it’s root device. 

- EBS volumes are redundant, "virtual" drives, which are not tied to any particular hardware, however they are restricted to a particular EC2 availability zone. This means that an EBS volume can move from one piece of hardware to another within the same availability zone. 

- You can think of EBS volumes as a kind of Network Attached Storage.

## Autoscaling

- The idea that we want to automatically scale the amount of resources at our disposal
- Very powerful, and helpful in Industry
- But on a personal level, could accidentally accrue a lot of cost

- Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
    - Vertical Scaling: Increase the power of an instance/server
    - Horizontal Scaling: Increase the number of instances/servers
    - In older days, Vertical Scaling was primarily used
        - It took a lot of time to provision and configure new servers
    - In modern days, companies such as Amazon have setup really convenient ways
        to provision new servers
        - This has opened the door to Horizontal Scaling

Generally speaking, vertical scaling becomes more expensive, the higher scale you go. This becomes inefficient. Which makes Horizontal Scaling generally more efficient, money-wise.

Event small comapnies must now be prepared to scale their products globally. This of course has many challenges. But since that is where the demand is, that is where the money is.


# DevOps

## What is DevOps?
DevOps (Development and Operations) is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity

Thus...evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

### What Problems does DevOps try to solve?

- App is deployed on EC2 and running….

- What if we want to change something in the src code?

- Takes a long time to change source code, push to github, git clone into EC2 instance, restart Tomcat server….

## The CI/CD Pipeline
### Continuous Integration

Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch.

- It’s meant to prevent large errors from accumulating
- Allows for immediate correction of errors while they’re still small

### Continuous Deployment
Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 

This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

### Continuous Delivery
Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn't a "release day" anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work go live minutes after they've finished working on it.

# SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) Review:

Outlines the process to plan, create, test, and deploy information systems and appliations

## SDLC Follows these 7 general steps:

1. Requirements Phase
2. Analysis Phase
3. Design Phase
4. Development Phase
5. Testing Phase
6. Integration and Deployment Phase
7. Maintenance Phase

There are are two main approaches to SDLC currently:

-   Waterfall
    - Linear Approach
    - Rigid
    - "Old-Fashioned
-   Agile
    - Iterative Approach
    - Most Popular
    - Focuses on Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation


# Scrum Concepts
