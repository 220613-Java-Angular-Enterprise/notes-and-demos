# TCL

-   Used to manage transactions within the database (more on this later)
-   Syntax/Keywords for TCL:
    -   `COMMIT`: this will permanently save any DML operations that occurred
    -   `ROLLBACK`: this will completely erase any DML operations that occurred between two commits. Keep in mind, once you commit changes you cannot rollback
    -   `SAVEPOINT`: creates a spot to rollback to


# Acid Properties

In SQL every transaction must have a specific four properties, these are know as the ACID properties

**Atomic:** All or nothing, the transaction is fully completed, or it doesn't happen at all

**Consistency:** The tables schema will remain intact after the transaction

**Isolation:** Each transaction cannot affect the results of another transaction

**Durability:** Data will persist through system crashes and other issues

# Aggregate and Scalar Functions

Aggregate functions take multiple rows, and combine the values into one single column

Some popular aggregates functions are as follows:

-   MAX(Column): returns the max value of that column
-   MIN(Column): returns the min value of that column
-   AVG(Column): returns the average value of that column
-   SUM(Column): adds and returns the sum of the values in the column
-   COUNT(column): returns the number of elements in that column

These function are used in the SELECT clause, and cannot be used with the WHERE clause

If more than one column is being selected in the SELECT column section of the query, a GROUP By is required

You can use the HAVING clause with an aggregate function instead of WHERE

Scalar functions operate on a single row, these can be used with SELECT and WHERE

Some popular scalar functions are as follows:

-   LENGTH(string): returns the length of a string in the given row
-   UPPER(string): returns the string in upper case
-   LOWER(string): returns the string in lower case
-   ABS(num): returns the absolute value of the row
-   CEILING(num): returns the rounded up number
-   FLOOR(num): returns the rounded down number

# Joins

<img src = "https://www.dofactory.com/img/sql/sql-joins.png">

- allows us to create a single query which spans across multiple tables in our db
- there are various different types of joins, based on what information you would like from each table, and how you define the tables to be joined together
- the typical join syntax is a follows:
- inner, left (outer), right (outer), full (outer)

```sql
select [columns]
from [left table]
left/right/full join [right table]
on [join predicate];
```

There are various different types of joins, based on what information you would like from each table, and how you define a join predicate. A *theta* join is just a join which joins two tables based on some condition (defined above as the join predicate). An *equi* join, is a theta join, where that condition uses equality. 

```sql 
select employee.name, department.name
from employee
left join department
on department.id = employee.department;
```

We also have such joins as *natural* joins. These joins are implicit and do not need a join predicate. Instead, the join is performed based on columns with the same names. In the employee/department example above, if the department table had an id column with the name 'dept_id' and the employee table had a column with the name 'dept_id' which referred to the department table, a natural join could be performed.

```sql 
select employee.name, department.name
from employee
natural join department
```

# Set Operations

<img src= "https://www.essentialsql.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SetOperators.png">

Set operators are different from joins. Instead of combining columns of two tables, set operators combine the rows of different result sets. Essentially, set operators perform some kind of (set) operation on two different queries.

Some set operators are:

* UNION [ALL]
  * UNION does not keep duplicates, but UNION ALL will
* INTERSECT
  * Only returns records in common between the queries
* EXCEPT
  * Removes from the first result set any rows that appear in the second result set and returns what remains


# Index 

An index is a common way to enhance database performance, enabling faster retrieval. When creating an index, the database stores an in memory ordering of a particular column. Without an index, if we were searching on a particular column, we would need to check every single value in that column to return the result. Indexes allow those operations to be more efficient. Columns which are searched on frequently, and that have a high percent of unique values and a low percent of null values are generally good candidates for an index. While indexes can make searching operations more efficient, we need to be careful not to use indexes too liberally. Because we are storing an additional ordering in memory, they need to be maintained every time we perform operations like insertions and deletions, so they may not always be the best choice.

# Views

There are two types of views in Postgres which allow us to view a dataset from a query. A traditional *view* will store a query in memory. Each time we make a request to that view, the query is executed and the result set is retrieved from the database.  There is also such thing as a *materialized view.* This type of view stores the actual dataset in memory. Each time we make a request to a materialized view, it does not execute the query again, but rather returns the saved dataset. To update the dataset, the materialized view must be refreshed.

```sql
create [materialized] view as [query]
```

# Normalization

Normalization refers to an optimization process of structuring a relational database in a way that *reduces redundancy* of data and improves data integrity and consistency. There are many different normal forms, which relate to the degree to which a database has been normalized. We will look at the first three normal forms, each of which build upon the previous:

* 1NF - must have a primary key, no repeating groups, and atomic columns
* 2NF - must already be in 1NF, plus have no partial dependencies
* 3NF - must already be in 2NF, plus have no transitive dependencies

The first normal form enforces that a table **must**:
* Have a primary key
* Each column should be as granular as possible (e.g. "Name" column should be broken up into: "First Name", "Last Name", "Middle Name", etc..)

To be in second normal form, a table must **also**:
* Cannot have columns that are dependent on only one part of the key
* If there are no composite primary keys, you are automatically in 2NF

Finally, to get to third normal form, a table must **also**:
* Not have transitive dependencies
* This means that if column C relates to column B which relates to column A which is the primary key, this is not in 3NF because C is related to the primary key but indirectly (it is a transitive dependency)

To advance into higher normal forms, we typically "break up" tables into multiple tables and relate them to each other via foreign keys.
