# Greedy Algorithms

A Greedy Algorithm is a paradigm where in a given solution, at any specific stage, the algorithm will always choose the most immediate optimal solution to satisfy the current stage, even if it is not the most optimal for the entire solution. Therefore it is not always the most optimal paradigm to use, however, it is often the most lightweight and cost effective in terms of Time complexity and can be used incredibly effectively when used on sorted data.

Lets assume for example that we have the given tree and we want to write a greedy algorithm to determine the maximum total that the tree can provide as we traverse to the bottom of the tree.

With a greedy algorithm, we ignore the state of the solution overall and instead look at the immediate best solution. In this case, we start at the root node, 12, and have an immediate decision to make. We can either go down to the left node, 4, or we can go down to the right node, which is 16. Well, since our algorithm ONLY cares about what is right in front of it, it will always choose 16. Next we have a choice between 6 and 1, so our optimal choice is 6. Finally, that leads us to our last choice: 35 or 21. The optimal choice is 35 meaning our total is 12 + 16 + 6 + 35 = 59.

However, you may have noticed that while our greedy solution _thought_ it had the most optimal solution, it did not account for the sub branches of the less optimal immediate choice. If you look at the solution below, you can see that there is a more optimal solution overall. If we decide to sacrifice our first choice and go down the left path to 4, and then take the choice of 22, and finally the choice of 98, leading to a combined total of 12 + 4 + 22 + 98 = 136. For this type of a solution, you may want to refer to either Backtracking or Branch and Bound algorithms that always find the most optimal overall solution.

# Factory Pattern
Factory is a design pattern which creates objects in which the precise type may not be known until runtime. To make a factory, use:
1. Abstract data type
2. Classes that inherit the abstract data type (the objects whose instantiation details may not be known until runtime)
3. Static method that returns a concrete instance, whose return type is the abstract data type in (1)
```java
    // Abstract Data Type
    public interface Dessert {}

    // Classes that inherit the abstract data type
    public class Cake implements Dessert {}

    public class Cookie implements Dessert {}

    public class IceCream implements Dessert {}

    // Good practice to throw an exception if the desired concrete instance is not found
    public class DessertNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {}

    // Factory class that returns the concrete instance
    public class DessertFactory {
        public static Dessert getDessert(String dessertType) {
            switch(dessertType) {
                case "cake":
                    return new Cake();
                case "cookie":
                    return new Cookie();
                case "ice cream":
                    return new IceCream();
                default:
                    throw new DessertNotFoundException(dessertType + " not found!");
            }
        }

        public class Demo {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Dessert d1 = DessertFactory.getDessert("cake");
                Dessert d2 = DessertFactory.getDessert("cookie");
                Dessert d3 = DessertFactory.getDessert("ice cream");
                Dessert d4 = DessertFactory.getDessert("candy");    // Throws DessertNotFoundException
            }
        }
    }
```

# Dependency Injection
Another important design pattern which is widely used in frameworks across many languages is [**dependency injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Setter_injection) (DI), which is one form of a broader concept called [**inversion of control**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) (IOC). DI means that the *dependencies* of a class or object are *declared by the class and then injected* from its context instead of instantiating and relying directly on it.

There are several ways to inject dependencies:
1. [Constructor injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Constructor_injection)
2. [Setter injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Setter_injection)
3. [Interface injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Interface_injection)

We'll show an example of constructor injection with two classes. If class `Foo` depends on a class `Bar`, the `Foo` class would NOT directly instantiate a `Bar` object. Instead, it would declare an instance variable of type `Bar` and have it injected. The code which uses `Foo` is then responsible for **injecting** an instance of `Bar` for `Foo` to use.

#### Before DI
```java
public class Foo {
  public void useBar() {
    Bar b = new Bar();
	b.doSomething();
  }
}
```

#### After DI
```java
public class Foo {
  Bar b;
  
  public Foo(Bar b) {
    this.b = b;
  }
  
  public void useBar() {
    b.doSomething();
  }
}

public class FooDriver {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bar b = new Bar();
	Foo f = new Foo(b);
	f.useBar();
  }
}
```

### Benefits of DI
Dependency injection has many benefits, including:
* decoupling of code
* independent development - coding to interfaces allows concurrent development
* abstraction - no need to rely on concrete implementation
* easier to test - allows creation of stubs and mocks
* configuration can be externalized
