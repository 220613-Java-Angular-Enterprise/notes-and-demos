# Parameterization with Angular Environment Variables

In Angular we can setup different Environments with different variables with environment.ts files in the environments folder

This is useful if you are developing locally, then need to change the address to the backend server whenever you are deploying the application

The default file is just called environment.ts, as you create more defined environments you name the files such as environment.prod.ts

The build script will look at the defualt environment.ts file if no other environment is specified at build time

An example environment.ts might look like this

```js
export const environment = {
	production: false,
	apiURL: 'http://url'
};
```

To use the variables you set up in the environment file you would import the file in the component you are using it in

To setup using other environment files, you must go into the angular.json file and setup the different environments you want under the fileReplacements section in the configuration

For example, under the "production" section of the angular.json we can setup fileReplacements to replace the default environment.ts with a environment.prod.ts to take in our production variables

To build the application in the production environment run the command `ng build --configuration=staging`

# Lazy Loading modules

By default, Modules are eagerly loaded, which means that as soon as the application is loaded all of the NgModules also load all at once, whether we need them to or not

For large applications with lots of routes this can adversly affect the loading times, and you should probably consider lazy loading for these modules for larger applications

Lazy loading is a design pattern that loads NgModules only as needed, helping keep initial bundle sizes smaller which in turn helps decrease load times

## Setting Up lazy loading with routes

To lazy load modules you want to use `loadChildren` in your routing module rather than `component`

Then inside of the lazy loaded modules routing module, add a route for that component, and be sure to remove the originally eager loaded module from the AppModule

# Testing in Angular with Jasmine and Karma

The Angular CLI automatically downloads and installs everything you need to test Angular with the Jasmine framework

Jasmine is a open-source behavior-driven development unit testing framework for Javascript

-   It is made by Pivotal Labs
-   It works with plain JS, Node.JS, Angular/Typescript, Python, Ruby

Jasmine files are `file.spec.ts`

To create a test in the Jasmine files you create a describe fuction, that describes the test suite, as well as takes a callback function

Syntax for a testsuite in Jasmine looks similar to this:

```javascript
describe('Name/description of test suite', () => {
	it('should do something', () => {
		expect(actualValue).toBe(expectedValue);
		expect(actualValue.toBeTruthy();
		expect(actualValue.toBeFalsy();
		expect(actualValue).toEqual(expectedValue);
		expect(actualValue).not.toBe(notExpectedValue);
	}
});
```
You can also use functions such as:
-   beforeEach()
-   beforeAll()
-   afterEach()
-   afterAll()
    inside of the describe function to perform some task before or after individual tests
To run you tests you simple run `ng test` and it will launch the Karma test runner
Karma is a test runner for Jasmine tests, like Jasmine it is preinstalled when we create out Angular application with the CLI
