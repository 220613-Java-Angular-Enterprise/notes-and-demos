            <head>
                contains information about the page, rather than the information shown.
                We can include some information within the head such as:
                - <style> tag to apply internal CSS styling to the webpage
                - <link> tag for making use of an external resource (external CSS)
                - <script> tag for making use of JavaScript, which makes our webpages more dynamic - NOT ideal!
                - <meta> tag for including meta-information about the content of the page -- used more for SEO purposes
                - <title> tag for the title of the webpage.
