# Deadlock

The term "deadlock" describes a situation where 2 or more threads are blocked trying to access the same resource, waiting for the other. Neither thread can continue execution, so the program halts indefinitely.

## `synchronized` keyword
In a multithreaded environment, a race condition occurs when 2 or more threads attempt to access the same resource. Using the synchronized keyword on a piece of logic enforces that only one thread can access the resource at any given time. synchronized blocks or methods can be created using the keyword. Also, one way a class can be "thread-safe" is if all of its methods are synchronized.

# Date Time API

Java 8 introduced new APIs for Date and Time to address the shortcomings of the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.

- **Thread safety** – The Date and Calendar classes are not thread safe, leaving developers to deal with the headache of hard-to-debug concurrency issues and to write additional code to handle thread safety. On the contrary, the new Date and Time APIs introduced in Java 8 are immutable and thread safe, thus taking that concurrency headache away from developers.

- **API design and ease of understanding** – The Date and Calendar APIs are poorly designed with inadequate methods to perform day-to-day operations. The new Date/Time API is ISO-centric and follows consistent domain models for date, time, duration and periods. There are a wide variety of utility methods that support the most common operations.

- **ZonedDate and Time** – Developers had to write additional logic to handle time-zone logic with the old APIs, whereas with the new APIs, handling of time zone can be done with Local and ZonedDate/Time APIs.

# Trees

Trees are data structures are used to store and organize data. We can use algorithms to manipulate and use our data structures. Different types of data are organized more efficiently by using different data structures.

Trees are non-linear data structures. They are often used to represent hierarchical data. For a real-world example, a hierarchical company structure uses a tree to organize.

Trees are a collection of nodes (vertices), and they are linked with edges (pointers), representing the hierarchical connections between the nodes. A node contains data of any type, but all the nodes must be of the same data type.

Components of Trees:

- Root: The root of a tree is a node that has no incoming link (i.e. no parent node). Think of this as a starting point of your tree.

- Children: The child of a tree is a node with one incoming link from a node above it (i.e. a parent node). If two children nodes share the same parent, they are called siblings.

- Parent: The parent node has an outgoing link connecting it to one or more child nodes.

- Leaf: A leaf has a parent node but has no outgoing link to a child node. Think of this as an endpoint of your tree.

## Binary Search Tree

- All child nodes in the tree to the right of the root node must be greater than the current node

- Opposite is true for the left (decreases)

- Node can only have 2 children max

- Insertion, Deletion, and Lookup are all O(log N)

# JPA and Hibernate

## ORM

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. 
When talking about ORM, most people are referring to a library or framework that implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase "an ORM".

## JPA vs. Hibernate (Specification vs. Implementation)

- Today, Hibernate ORM is one of the most mature JPA implementations, and still a popular option for ORM in Java.

- Java Persistence API is a collection of classes and methods to persistently store the vast amounts of data into a database which is provided by the Oracle Corporation.

- By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that can be implemented by any tool or framework.
